Chronos is a static race detector for the Go language written in Go.

## Quick Start:
Download the package
```
go get -u -v github.com/amit-davidson/Chronos
```
Compile the program
```
cd cmd && go build -o chronos
```

Pass the entry point
```
chronos --file <path_to_main>
```

Help
```
Usage of ./chronos:
  -file string
    	The file containing the entry point of the program
  -pkg string
    	Path to the to pkg of the file. Tells Chronos where to perform the search. By default, it assumes the file is inside $GOPATH
```

## Features:
Support:
- Detects races on pointers passed around the program.
- Analysis of conditional branches, nested functions, interfaces, and defers.
- Synchronization using mutex and goroutines starts.

Limitations:
- Big programs and external packages. (Due to stack overflow)
- Analysis of panics, for loops, goto, recursion, and select.
- Synchronization using channels, waitgroups, once, cond and atomic.

## Chronos vs go race:
Chronos successfully reports cases where go race fails thanks to his static nature. Mostly because data races appear in unexpected production workloads, which are hard to produce in dev.
In addition, go race is having trouble with short programs where without contrived synchronization the program may exit too quickly.
 
In contrast, Chronos managed to report only 244/403 = 60.5% of go race test cases. This can be explained by Chronos partial support with Go's features so this number will increase in the future. 
Also, it lacked due to his static nature where context/path/flow sensitivity was required.

Therefore, I suggest using both according the strengths and weaknesses of each of the race detectors.
